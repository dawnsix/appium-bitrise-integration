The human diet is rich with molecules that have been shown to play a role in both the prevention and treatment of viral diseases, by interacting with drugs, or by acting as “medicines” themselves. However, the traditional practicalities involved in investigating the influence of a single drug or food component would take too long to have an impact on this crisis.  \nPowered by you, our Dreamers, the DreamLab Corona-AI project combines artificial intelligence and the processing power of idle smartphones to speed up the discovery of novel anti-viral components in existing medicines and help the hunt for anti-viral molecules in foods. Together, we can help fight the coronavirus. ",

A human genome comprises 6.4 billion letters, or genotypes. Most of these letters are unchanged in all people, but typically each person has approximately 5 million genetic variants that are unique to that individual. Project demystify seeks to use phenotypic information derived from clinical information and possibly also from wearable devices like Fitbits that will be correlated with the genomes of those same people. The nature of the phenotypic information determines the most appropriate correlation test - each of which is computationally expensive. It is these complex calculations that will be computed via Project Demystify on users phones.",

        "description": "This large multiphase scientific project called DRUGS (for \"Drugs Repurposing Using Grids of Smartphones\")  aims to determine how different cancer types can be treated with existing drugs or their combinations. This speeds up the drug discovery process by re-purposing drugs, therefore providing more effective anti-cancer treatments, quicker. Using your phone's processing power and an algorithm contained within the app, when you power DreamLab you will calculate how different drugs and new combinations of drugs can be used as a treatment for different cancer types based on genetic data from cancer patients. DreamLab provides the computing power needed to determine how different genetic mutations effect the drug outcomes.\nAs always, when it comes to the search for a better anti-cancer treatment, no \"fast\" is ever fast enough, thus we are aiming to speed up research even further with the results already obtained, thanks to your effort and support of DreamLab and DRUGS project. To achieve this we have split the  project into several phases. The original project now being called Phase 1 has already provided (and still provides) us with the essential knowledge about the intricate drug - cancer and drug - drug interactions. With this knowledge we can start a faster Phase 2 to focus on genetically tailored individual drug recommendations without fully completing the Phase 1. Phase 2 would be followed soon by the Phase 3 and Phase 4 on combinatorial treatment possibilities.\nPlease support the new phases of the project as they become available! Thanks to your help and contribution we can help beat cancer faster and better! Let's not just dream about the World without cancer, but #SleepLikeAHero to actually help it happen!",

        "description": "The genome, i.e. the complex of genetic information contained in our DNA, is altered by mutations in cancer. Even if affected by the same tumor type, each patient is to some degree unique for his own specific set of mutations. For this reason, there is still a large variability in how individual patients respond to therapy. Understanding the genetic basis of heterogeneity across tumor patients is crucial to identify more personalized therapies.\n\nTo this concern, research leveraging bioinformatics tools and cancer genomics data can provide relevant contributions.\n\nFor the DreamLab \"3D genome\" project we have developed software taking advantage of proactive collaborations by DreamLab users for a bioinformatic analysis of data on the 3D organization of the DNA. The results obtained from these analyses will aid the interpretation of specific mutations in cancer patients. The final goal is to obtain a more comprehensive picture of each individual tumor to better define prognosis and, as a consequence, identify a personalized therapy.\n\nThe participation of users to this citizen science project will allow analyzing rapidly a large amount of data by the DreamLab app, using your phone’s processing power.\n\nThe project will focus at first on breast cancer, one of the most common tumor types, then extend to other highly dangerous tumor types including lung and pancreas cancers.",

Your dreaming and your phone have helped to uncover more exciting discoveries. We have revealed further insights into the potential application of existing antiparasitic medicines in anti-cancer therapy. In addition, we have identified that the potential anti-cancer effects of leafy vegetables, such as cabbage or broccoli, are the result of a combination of specific molecules from highly diverse chemical classes such as indoles, flavonoids and terpenoids. This discovery highlights the power of AI and DreamLab mobile supercomputing in investigating and understanding the potential role of diet in the fight against cancer.  \n \nIn this phase, we seek to get deeper insights into the mechanism of interactions between bioactive molecules present in foods, drugs and cancer genomes for optimization of the current therapeutic strategies and improvement of the patient care. We know that complex multi-factorial interactions between foods and drugs have profound influence on the success of a drug treatment and on the side-effect profiles of many drugs. Therefore, understanding drug–food interactions is critical to minimize unexpected adverse drug events and maximize synergistic benefits when treating a disease. At first, we are planning to investigate colon, gastric, pancreatic and liver cancers.",

        "description": "Welcome to Phase 3 of this large citizen-powered scientific project called DRUGS (or \"Drug Repurposing Using Grids of Smartphones\"). Thanks to your contribution, in Phase 2 we completed the calculations of tailoring individual drugs to cancer genetics and identified promising drug candidates for further study. Now we’re ready to take the leap into Phase 3 to search for the best drug combinations for each cancer type, to offer more optimized therapies. Our overall aim is to speed up cancer drug discovery by using a combination of super-computing (powered by you Dreamers!), AI and big genomics data to match existing drugs to cancer genetics and their insidious networks. Cancer is not just one disease, it’s many different diseases with their own genomes and molecular networks that promote their survival. The traditional approach of finding \"one drug for one target\" is therefore too limited if what we need to do is target a whole system. DreamLab takes a radically different approach. Using your phone’s processing power and an algorithm in the app, when you power DreamLab you calculate how different drugs and drug combinations can be used as a treatment for different cancer types and their networks based on genetic data from cancer patients. Join us on this exciting endeavour - the future is powered by you!",

        "description": "The genome, i.e. the complex of genetic information contained in our DNA, is altered by mutations in cancer. Even if affected by the same tumour type, each patient is to some degree unique for his own specific set of mutations. For this reason, there is still a large variability in how individual patients respond to therapy. Understanding the genetic basis of heterogeneity across tumour patients is crucial to identify more personalized therapies.\nTo this point, research leveraging bioinformatics tools and cancer genomics data can provide relevant contributions.\nFor the DreamLab \"3D genome\" project we have developed software taking advantage of proactive collaborations by DreamLab users for a bioinformatic analysis of data on the 3D organization of the DNA.\nIn the project \"Phase 1\" we have analysed data to reconstruct the architecture of the genome on a large scale. In the current \"Phase 2\" we will instead go to a higher resolution to pinpoint specific interactions between distant DNA regions.\nThe results obtained from these analyses will aid the interpretation of specific mutations in cancer patients. The final goal is to obtain a more comprehensive picture of each individual tumour to better define prognosis and, as a consequence, identify a personalized therapy.\nThe participation of users to this citizen science project will allow rapid analysis of a large amount of data by the DreamLab app, using your phone’s processing power.\nThe project will focus at first on breast cancer, one of the most common tumour types, then extend to other highly dangerous tumour types including lung and pancreatic cancers.",

        "description": "Welcome into the Phase 2 of this large multiphase scientific project called DRUGS (for \"Drugs Repurposing Using Grids of Smartphones\")  which aims to determine how different cancer types can be treated with existing drugs or their combinations. Thanks to your contribution, this speeds up the drug discovery process by re-purposing drugs, therefore providing more effective anti-cancer treatments, quicker. Using your phone's processing power and an algorithm contained within the app, when you power DreamLab you will calculate how different drugs and new combinations of drugs can be used as a treatment for different cancer types based on genetic data from cancer patients. DreamLab provides the computing power needed to determine how different genetic mutations affect the drug outcomes.\n\nAs always, when it comes to the search for a better anti-cancer treatment, no \"fast\" is ever fast enough, thus we are aiming to speed up research even further with the results already obtained, thanks to your effort and support of DreamLab and DRUGS project. We have already processed the partial results obtained so far from the Phase 1 of this project and started a faster Phase 2 to focus on genetically tailored individual drug recommendations, to be followed soon by the more complex Phase 3 and Phase 4 on combinatorial treatment possibilities.\n\nPlease support the new phases of the project as they become available and this new Phase 2 especially! We need you! Thanks to your help and contribution we can help beat cancer faster and more effectively!
