        <h1>The best sleep-saving apps</h1>
        <p>Well… they don’t. In 2007, Huffington collapsed due to sleep deprivation and then, like any good media mogul, she wrote the book on it. Unlike other successful CEOs (Huffington sold her news site to AOL in 2011 for $315 million) sleep is now at the top of her To Do list. With Apple’s iOS 10 offering a new Bedtime feature, and a growing range of apps and wearables aimed to assist sleep and improve wellbeing, now’s the time for a sleep renaissance!</p> <h2>What’s so good about sleep anyway?</h2> <p>You’ve probably heard of the circadian rhythm: the internal body clock that naturally syncs and adjusts to your external environment. As we move through the day and night, our rhythm dips and peaks at different times. The fatigue during the dips is less intense if we’re getting a good night’s sleep, and more intense if we’re not. It doesn&#8217;t take a neuroscientist to see that sleep makes for a more alert, productive human.</p> <p>Sleep helps clear toxic byproducts from our brains, aids in memory formation, and it allows our bodies to release growth hormones, which helps muscles repair, bones grow and the regulation of body fluids. Sleep also allows the body to metabolise sugars and fats.</p> <p>On the flip side, sleep deprivation can suppress our immune systems, increase blood pressure, and lead to obesity, not to mention downgrade emotional intelligence and alertness. Lack of sleep lifts cortisol levels: the stress hormone that activates reward centres in the brain and makes us want food. Sleeplessness messes with our ability to use insulin, making it harder for cells to remove fatty acids and lipids from the blood stream.</p> <p>Our current ‘always on’ culture is bad news for our bodies. Dr. Charles Czeisler, the Baldino Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, calls it downright dangerous. Being ‘on’ around the clock, according to Czeisler, induces a level of impairment every bit as risky as intoxication.</p> <p>People who average four hours of sleep a night for five consecutive days develop the same level of cognitive impairment as if they’d been awake for 24 hours – equivalent to legal drunkenness. However, as the conversations around the importance of sleep grow, employers are starting to take note. In the US, workers at insurance provider Aetna now earn $25 for every 20 nights they get over seven hours sleep; it’s part of the company’s ‘sleep program’.</p> <h2>Sleep mobility</h2> <p>According to a 2015 consumer mobility report, 71% of Americans sleep next to their smartphones. In Australia, 72% of us use phones within an hour of sleeping (excluding setting an alarm.) This sounds like bad sleep practice, unless your smartphone is helping you snooze. Enter sleep apps: programs that track your shut-eye, and build data to help you understand what triggers a good, and bad, night’s rest.</p> <p>Tried and tested options include Sleepbot, which is free and widely considered one of the best sleep apps (the US National Institute of Health even gave it a nod). It’s packed with features to track sleep patterns, which include monitoring motion and listening to night noises (snoring and talking); it’ll also nudge you awake during a phase of lighter rest. Sleepbot captures and files data over six months, and displays it via interactive graphs. This is great if you want to understand your shorter-term sleep patterns, but those looking for longer data sets (which is where sleep apps can really be helpful) will need to back up the info online.</p> <div id="attachment_1152" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-post wp-image-1152" src="http://stats.b2dreamlab.com/testing/news_images/image58-760x428.jpeg" alt="SleepCycle gives you a play-by-play of how well you're resting.

Source: SleepCycle</p></div><p></p> <p><a href="https://www.sleepcycle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleep Cycle</a> tracks your stats over weeks, months, and years. And while it doesn’t monitor sounds, it does detect motion, observe white noise, and include a heart rate monitor. The longer you use the app, the more you can understand about how real trends in both your internal and external environments (such as weather, stress, and hormonal shifts) alter sleep. Sleep Cycle’s alarm can also be adjusted to go off when your body is in a light sleep state. If you choose to nap, it’ll shift into a snooze pattern, playing your chosen wake-up song increasingly louder until it nudges you up. If you don&#8217;t want to go the full sleep app, but like the idea of a kind wake up, try Warmly or Gentle Alarm.</p> <p>Need help hitting the sack? The goal of Pzizz is to coach you to sleep or help induce a power nap. For more comprehensive info while you sleep and wake, <a href="https://24-7.motionx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MotionX 24/7</a> tracks sleep habits, but also monitors steps and heart rate, plus it integrates with Apple’s Health app so you can get a sense of how daily activity impacts your rest.</p>

         <p>For complete nighttime analysis, products like <a href="https://hello.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sense</a> also monitor the environment inside your bedroom (light, temperature, humidity, noise and air quality) and combine these results with your nocturnal movements, which are recorded by a sleep tracker that clips to your pillow. The collected data is synced to an app on your smartphone.</p> <h2>Putting sleep to work</h2> <p>All this sleep data is understandably pretty self-involved, but you can achieve a lot while you rest your head. The <a href="https://www.vodafone.com.au/foundation/dreamlab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DreamLab app</a>  uses the power of your idle smartphone to help process the mountains of data around cancer research when you’re not using it at all. Simply download it, fall asleep, and you’re doing two great things at once; it’s as simple as closing your eyes.</p>

        <h1>A race to solve the hidden clues of pancreatic cancer</h1>
        <p>Unlike other cancers, there are no real telling signs of when pancreatic cancer hits a person. People often mistake the symptoms of pancreatic cancer as signs of other common illnesses like a flu or food poisoning. These symptoms include loss of appetite and weight loss, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, and pain in the back or abdomen.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Pancreatic cancer is a difficult disease for doctors to diagnose because the symptoms of the disease are so general. Some of these symptoms may be jaundice, weight loss, and abdominal pain &#8212; all things that are more likely due to other more common illnesses. This means that by the time a patient receives a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, the disease is usually at an advanced stage,” said Dr Lorraine Chantrill, medical oncologist of The Kinghorn Cancer Centre and honorary research fellow at Garvan Institute of Medical Research.</p> <p>But researcher Tony Hu and his team of Arizona State University have recently come across a potential technique that could help with the early detection of pancreatic cancer.</p> <p>In conducting a trial study with 59 patients who have been diagnosed with the killer disease, 48 healthy patients, and 48 with a similar disease known as pancreatitis, the test was able to successfully identify a particular protein known as EphA2 through tiny blood samples in 90% of the cases. The trial could possibly serve as an early warning sign of the earliest stages of pancreatic cancer.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Pancreatic cancer is one type of cancer we desperately need an early blood biomarker for,” <a href="https://biodesign.asu.edu/news/sentinels-blood-new-diagnostic-pancreatic-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hu says</a>.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Other technology has been used for detection, but it doesn’t work very well because of the nature of this cancer. It’s really hard to capture an early diagnostic signal when there are no symptoms. It’s not like breast cancer, where you may feel pain and you can easily check for an abnormal growth.”</p> <div id="attachment_1526" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-post wp-image-1526" src="http://stats.b2dreamlab.com/testing/news_images/Pancreatic-cancer-760x427.png" alt="" width="760" height="427"  sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Exosomes are a form of extracellular vesicle (EV) released from most kinds of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Once thought to be mere detritus from cellular metabolism, they are now linked with many critical forms of cell signalling and immune function and play a vital role in a host of diseases, particularly cancer, where they may act to aid metastasis and thwart anti-cancer therapies.</p></div><p></p> <p>While it’s still early days, the discovery gives Vodafone Foundation further motivation to garner ongoing support for pancreatic cancer research carried out by Australian-based <a href="https://www.garvan.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garvan Institute of Medical Research</a> through the <a href="https://www.vodafone.com.au/red-wire/dreamlab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DreamLab app</a>, which uses your smartphone’s computing power to solve cancer research problems faster.

It kills 95% of those that it affects within five years, there is no early detection test and few treatment options. So far researchers have been unable to unlock the secret to pancreatic cancer and we must do more,” said Dr Chantrill.</p> <blockquote><p>Download the <a class="gr-progress" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.vodafone.dreamlabapp&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DreamLab app</a> now, and help solve cancer while you sleep.</p></blockquote>

        <h1>DreamLab makes top five in global technology tally</h1>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in Australia, our very own <a href="https://www.vodafone.com.au/red-wire/dreamlab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DreamLab app</a> totted up at number five.  The app, </span><a href="https://www.vodafone.com.au/foundation/dreamlab" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched on iOS and Android a few weeks ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is changing the landscape of cancer research as we know it, through the power of smartphones. Built in partnership with </span><a href="https://www.garvan.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Garvan Institute of Medical Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the app aims to uncover truths about cancer hidden within its DNA, by comparing different types of cancer cells.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For users, it’s simple: plug in your phone at night, open the app, and information on the research puzzles solved is sent back to Garvan researchers via the Amazon cloud – like a giant crossword puzzle, with each app user solving a different part.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with DreamLab, the rest of the Vodafone technology top-ten reads like a sci-fi novel, built around a network that is trailblazing across a variety of industries, worldwide:  </span></p> <div id="attachment_2292" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-post wp-image-2292" src="http://stats.b2dreamlab.com/testing/news_images/moon-760x506.jpg" alt="Moon" width="760" height="506"  sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">PTS have built ALINA, their Autonomous Landing and Navigation Module, which will be carried to the moon on board the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and is expected to touch down near the Apollo 17 landing sit</p></div><p></p> <p><strong>1. Mission to the Moon – Andreas Roth, Technical Project Leader Mission to the Moon at the Vodafone Innovation Park Labs: </strong>PT Scientists (PTS), a Berlin-based startup is working with Vodafone Germany and Audi to achieve the first private moon landing, create the moon’s first telecoms network and take the first ever hi-res photos of the site where Neil Armstrong once took a small step for a man and a giant leap for mankind.</p> <p><strong>2. Intelligent Transport System &#8211; Luke Ibbetson, Vodafone Group Head of Research and Development and Technology Strategy:</strong> Vodafone has recently opened a 5G Mobility Lab at the Aldenhoven Testing Center in Germany, which will be one of the first places in Europe to test out the actual usage of 5G. The team will be testing <a href="http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/what/technology-blog/emergency-braking.html">C-V2X</a>, a technology that will be a key transport safety feature as part of a future  Intelligent Transport System that connects vehicles, roadside infrastructure and pedestrians.</p> <p><strong>3. Chat anywhere &#8211; Santiago Tenorio, Vodafone Group Head of Network Strategy &amp; Architecture:</strong> Increasingly, customers want to be connected at all times. But despite the widespread coverage provided by mobile networks, there are still places that don’t get signal (for example, deep indoors or within some lifts). Vodafone was the first operator in the world to launch NB-IoT, a Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) network technology which provides an opportunity to resolve this issue. Adding LPWA technologies that use licensed radio spectrum deep in the protocol stack can enable chat apps to adapt their software to use them. Doing so could complement other network technologies and keep chat apps working, even when it is not possible to use voice and internet data.</p> <p><strong><img class="size-post wp-image-2294 aligncenter" style="font-weight: normal;" src="http://stats.b2dreamlab.com/testing/news_images/drone-760x667.jpg" alt="" width="760" height="667"  sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></strong></p> <p><strong>4. Emergency drones &#8211; Antonio Oliver, New Technologies &amp; Innovation Manager, Vodafone Group’s Networks Centre of Excellence:</strong> Poor or non-existent cellular coverage is life-threatening in emergency situations. Vodafone Group’s New Technologies and Innovation team has been experimenting in the hills of northern Andalucía with mobile relays mounted on a drone. The relays are based on a specially adapted <a href="http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/what/technology-blog/crowdcell.html">CrowdCell</a>, because using that technology does not require modification of the cellular radio network to extend the cellular coverage. Using the Elistair tethering system to supply power, the drone was able to hover in position at up to 80 metres above ground level for periods of over a day — aiming to provide a crucial service for those in need.</p> <div class="wp-image-wrap"> <div class="wp-image-wrap"><img class="size-post wp-image-2311 aligncenter" src="http://stats.b2dreamlab.com/testing/news_images/DreamLab-tessa-760x667.jpg" alt="DreamLab app" width="760" height="667"  sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></div> <p><strong>5. DreamLab &#8211; Alyssa Jones, Head of Vodafone Australia Foundation: </strong>As above, the <a href="https://www.vodafone.com.au/red-wire/dreamlab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DreamLab app</a> was first launched in Australia to help the Garvan Institute for Medical Research harness the collective processing power of smartphones while they’re charging (usually at night, while the user is asleep). The Vodafone Foundation’s longer-term vision is to extend the potential for DreamLab by promoting it in various Vodafone markets in order to grow a large international base of ‘dreamers’, providing significant computing power so that researchers all over the globe undertaking cancer research can take advantage of this resource.</p> <p><strong>6. Big data for public health &#8211; Nuria Oliver, Vodafone’s Group Director of Research in Data Science:</strong> The analysis of ‘big data’ (large-scale, anonymised data sets) is profoundly changing the world. Vodafone’s data scientists are working on projects analysing how big data can be used to provide decision support to tackle problems of societal importance. The team recently worked with King’s College London to predict the wellbeing of individuals in the UK based upon where they live and work. They used data from the Office for National Statistics, which surveys wellbeing through four measures: life satisfaction, sense of worth, happiness, and anxiety level. They also used Foursquare data and large, anonymised mobile usage data sets. Through machine learning-based predictive models, they found that people with the highest wellbeing are likely to live near pubs and those with the lowest wellbeing near offices and fried chicken restaurants.</p> <p><strong>7. Zero latency gaming – Santiago Tenorio, Vodafone Group Head of Network Strategy &amp; Architecture:</strong> Massively multiplayer online games are a rapidly growing industry, increasingly involving both professional players and serious amateurs wanting premium performance from their gaming rigs. The amount of latency experienced by gamers is a major source of irritation as they spend more time playing, and often also needing to communicate in real time with other players, over the internet. To evolve our networks to enable gamers to get lower levels of latency, the team on this project are planning to use Multi-access Edge Computing to host applications virtually and therefore closer to customers, and are currently exploring pilots to host servers for gaming companies on our networks. This could provide a premium gaming experience for Vodafone customers.</p> <p><strong>8. Eva Facial Mouse – Santiago Moreno, Head of Vodafone Spain Foundation:</strong> EVA Facial Mouse is a free app which allows the user to control an Android device by tracking the movements of their head (you can download it<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crea_si.eviacam.service&amp;hl=en_GB"> here</a>). It provides an alternative method for accessing a mobile device for those who cannot use a touchscreen. It has already had over 1.7 million downloads and rated 4.4 out of 5 on the Google Play store with more than 11,000 evaluations.</p> <div id="attachment_2293" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-post wp-image-2293" src="http://stats.b2dreamlab.com/testing/news_images/Body-sensors-760x506.jpg" alt="" width="760" height="506"  sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Engineers from Vodafone’s Network Centre of Excellence have been experimenting with how different sensors can interact with smartwatches over a mobile network.</p></div><p></p> <p><strong>9. Body sensors – Kyriakos Exadaktylos, Vodafone Group Head of Network Standards: </strong>Working with the SUB2 project<a href="https://www.vodafone.com/content/index/what/technology-blog/sub2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> (which aims to help an athlete run a marathon in under two hours)</a>, the team on this project developed a smartwatch app that can be a better pacemaker for elite runners, using GPS location data that is up to 10 times more accurate. The SUB2 project aims to leave a lasting legacy for athletics by showing how technology can help improve performance. This work will also enable Vodafone to better support wearable manufacturers and connected health projects in future.</p> <p><strong>10. Malta biobank – Jason Pavia, Head of the Vodafone Malta Foundation:</strong> The Vodafone Foundation in Malta is working with The Centre for Molecular Medicine and Biobanking at the University of Malta to develop an online interactive IT platform and mobile app which will facilitate cutting edge research that explores genetic causes and potential treatments for diseases such as diabetes, asthma, thalassemia, and ALS. Up to 20,000 people in Malta alone could benefit from the work undertaken by the biobank, while the model, if successful, could inform genetic research across the globe.</p> <p><em>Download the app today from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.vodafone.dreamlabapp">App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.vodafone.dreamlabapp">Google Play</a> to start your DreamJob fighting cancer.</em></p> </div>

Health is everything. Life is so precious and if it’s taught me one thing, it’s that no moment or day is promised to us. I’ve touched on this before and I am doing so again because supporting cancer research is extremely meaningful to me. Many of you would know that I lost my best friend of 14 years to cancer just before I found out I was pregnant with Alina. It’s gut wrenching to watch someone you love, suffer, and after it all, to lose them. Cancer is a reality for so many individuals and their families and finding answers through medical research is incredibly important. That is why I am sharing the DreamLab app with you. Created by the @vodafoneau Foundation in partnership with The Garvan Institute, it uses the processing power of your idle phone to help solve cancer puzzles while you sleep! Hence the name &#8211; DreamLab. DreamLab is already working to crunch data in half the time as the Garvan Institute of Medical Research’s supercomputer! Forging a path towards personalised treatments for cancer. The mobile data needed to use DreamLab is free if you’re a @vodafoneau customer. If you’re not with @vodafoneau like me, you’ll use data from your mobile or Wi-fi plan. Don’t let that stop you though. DreamLab only uses small amounts of data and you can set a monthly limit!

        <h1>Help power genome cancer research for kids while powering up your device</h1>
        <p class="p1">Garvan’s researchers are passionate and tenacious. Their aim is to explore the power of genome sequencing to crack cancer’s code and help deliver better outcomes for young patients.</p> <h2 class="p1">What is genome sequencing?</h2> <p class="p1">Put simply, your genome is all of your DNA that determines how your body functions. Your genome is unique to you. Sequencing your genome can reveal changes in your genes that can lead to diseases like cancer, and can tell doctors a lot about how best to treat a person’s cancer.</p> <p class="p1">Such intensive and complex research requires huge amounts of time and money.</p> <p class="p1"><b>This is where you come in.</b></p> <p class="p1">The Vodafone Foundation has just released a limited edition smart device<a href="#features"><b> Genome</b> <b>Power Pack</b></a> with all proceeds from every sale of the handy $49 power pack going directly to Garvan to fund its mission.</p> <div class="wp-image-wrap"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2779 size-large" src="http://stats.b2dreamlab.com/testing/news_images/Genome-Power-Pack-Product-Shot-Packaging-and-Pack-702x1024.jpg" alt="Genome Power Pack product" width="702" height="1024"  sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div> <p class="p1"><a href="#stores">Over 100 Vodafone stores across Australia</a> are stocking the limited edition <b>Genome Power Pack. </b>So while you’re charging your phone, you can also help power important cancer research!</p> <p class="p1">With the funds raised by <b>Genome Power</b>, Garvan will bring the power of genome sequencing to every Aussie kid enrolled in the <a href="http://www.zerochildhoodcancer.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Zero Childhood Cancer Program</span></a> – the most ambitious childhood cancer initiative ever undertaken in Australia. Led by Children’s Cancer Institute and the Kids Cancer Centre at Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick, which is a part of the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network, Zero Childhood Cancer is the first ever personalised medicine program for children with high-risk or relapsed cancer in Australia, and brings together all major Australian clinical and research centres working in childhood cancer.</p> </div> <h2 class="p1">So, what is Genome Power?</h2> <p class="p1">The mission of Genome Power is to sequence and analyse the genomes from kids with high-risk, aggressive cancers. The information gained will then be combined with other clinical and research information from Zero Childhood Cancer partners.</p> <p class="p1">Armed with this knowledge, Garvan scientists work with the Children&#8217;s Cancer Institute and the Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children&#8217;s Hospital to identify better targeted treatments for each child. The aim is for each child to get precision treatment that matches their tumour.</p> <p class="p1">The right treatment for the right cancer at the right time. For the first time, this goal is within reach. Genome Power’s contribution to Zero Childhood Cancer is set to uncover crucial information about each child’s tumour and their risk of cancer. Combined with a wide range of other clinical and research information, this could help kids with cancer to lead a healthy, longer life.</p> <h2 class="p1">You can help children like Ava</h2> <p class="p1">Ava is a bright, energetic, free-spirited eight-year old girl from Sydney.</p> <p class="p1">Tony, Ava’s dad, will never forget the day she was diagnosed with cancer.</p> <p class="p1">“I was up at a mate’s house when the call came through from my wife Jen &#8211; ‘Get home quick, there is something wrong with Ava.’ Ava could hardly breathe, she looked petrified and was screaming – her eyes were rolling to the back of her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We thought we were going to lose her,” he explained.</p> <p class="p1">“What followed was a mad dash to the Emergency Department, where the doctors took charge immediately. At that stage we thought she had swallowed something, and that a quick pat on the back would reveal a foreign body and the panic would be over. This wasn’t the case.”</p>

         <p class="p1">Doctors x-rayed Ava and found fluid on her lungs was causing them to collapse, so they sent her for a CT scan.</p> <p class="p1">“At 3pm on the Saturday a bad nineteen hours turned into a nightmare. The CT scan had revealed a five-and-a-half centimetre tumour in her abdomen and chest.”</p> <p class="p1">Ava was diagnosed with cancer at six months of age.</p> <p class="p1">The days turned into weeks of whirlwind treatment. The young family’s normal Aussie suburban life was shaken into a traumatic cycle familiar to many cancer patients:  surgery; chemotherapy; recovery; and repeat.</p> <p class="p1">Ava spent two full years in treatment, in and out of the cancer ward at Sydney Children’s Hospital, enduring eight rounds of chemotherapy, amidst three major operations.
