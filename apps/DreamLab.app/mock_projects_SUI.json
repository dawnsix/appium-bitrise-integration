        "description": "How genetic variation (genotypes) correlate with clinical, or phenotypic information is a grand challenge facing biology today, and particularly its association with disease. A human genome comprises 6.4 billion letters, or genotypes. Most of these letters are unchanged in all people, but typically each person has approximately 5 million genetic variants that are unique to that individual. Project demystify seeks to use phenotypic information derived from clinical information and possibly also from wearable devices like Fitbits that will be correlated with the genomes of those same people. The nature of the phenotypic information determines the most appropriate correlation test - each of which is computationally expensive. It is these complex calculations that will be computed via Project Demystify on users phones.",
